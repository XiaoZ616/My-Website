            I wanted to write diary persistently before. <br>
            But I kept writing just few months.<br>
            From that time to now, I experienced so many things which make me almost a new man. <br>
            A couple of weeks ago, I saw a sentence when I watch videos on the Internet obsessively. <br>
            "Deciding how to preserve your memories by yourself, it's really cool." <br>
            At the same time, I start to learn HTML. <br>
            So I want to build a blog page of mine.<br>
            I will stick to updating it.&nbsp;&nbsp;(ÔΩ•‚Äôœâ‚ÄôÔΩ•)<br>

                            Just as I said in my Introduction, I changed a lot. So what I want to talk is too much.<br>
                            I always tried to find someone to pour out before.<br>
                            However, in this era, everyone is busy. People used to focus on their own immediate matters.<br>
                            I don't mean I am lack of true friends. Just we all don't have enough time to share everything.<br>
                            I am get rid of the bad habit now. But I found a new habit on me in recent time.üòÇ<br>

                            I don't know if I can keep going.<br>

                            Today I want to talk about material desire.<br>
                            I found myself desiring many electronics such as shining keyboards, noise-canceling headphone, smart glasses and so on.<br>
                            However, I can't spend too much money which comes from my perants as a student.<br>
                            I have saw many schoolmates around me spend money recklessly.<br>
                            They can be a mirror for me.<br>
                            <br>
                            Yesterday I said I will begin studying machine-learning but I found my computer without nvidia's GPU can hardly run the pytoch program.<br>
                            SO I must to save my pocket money in order to get a 3060 graghics card or higher configuration(I wish).<br>

                            Creation,freedom,beauty.Those are what I love.<br>
                            Maybe it sounds abstract and foolish. But I feel powerful when I work with them.<br>
                            Just like when I learning HTML to design my own web pages.
                            I often do it all afternoon.<br>
                            Because I can design my web freely with passion.<br>
                            Interest is the best teacher.<br>

                            The inspiration of this gift comes from &lt;The Three Body&lt;,a fantastic and world famous science fiction.<br>
                            In the story, a moribund man get an unexpective fortune.<br>
                            And he use the money to buy a fixed star for the girl he loves.<br>
                            I won't go into details what happened next.<br>
                            But it already show us its romance.<br>
                            In the crystal ball of my gift is the constellation of the star in the story.<br>
                            My friend and I both love the Three Body. Thus, I was so superising to receive the gift.üòò<br>
                            I felt one of the few blessings of life.<br>

                            I found that to receive the statics form returns, we need a web server.<br>
                            So I start to learn Flask now.<br>
