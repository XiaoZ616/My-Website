            I wanted to write diary persistently before. <br>
            But I kept writing just few months.<br>
            From that time to now, I experienced so many things which make me almost a new man. <br>
            A couple of weeks ago, I saw a sentence when I watch videos on the Internet obsessively. <br>
            "Deciding how to preserve your memories by yourself, it's really cool." <br>
            At the same time, I start to learn HTML. <br>
            So I want to build a blog page of mine.<br>
            I will stick to updating it.&nbsp;&nbsp;(ÔΩ•‚Äôœâ‚ÄôÔΩ•)<br>

                    Just as I said in my Introduction, I changed a lot. So what I want to talk is too much.<br>
                    I always tried to find someone to pour out before.<br>
                    However, in this era, everyone is busy. People used to focus on their own immediate matters.<br>
                    I don't mean I am lack of true friends. Just we all don't have enough time to share everything.<br>
                    I am get rid of the bad habit now. But I found a new habit on me in recent time.üòÇ<br>
                    Forget it. I need to get up from computer. My waist start to hurt.<br>

                    Today I want to talk about material desire.<br>
                    I found myself desiring many electronics such as shining keyboards, noise-canceling headphone, smart glasses and so on.<br>
                    However, I can't spend too much money which comes from my perants as a student.<br>
                    I have saw many schoolmates around me spend money recklessly.<br>
                    They can be a mirror for me.<br>
                    <br>
                    Yesterday I said I will begin studying machine-learning but I found my computer without nvidia's GPU can hardly run the pytoch program.<br>
                    SO I must to save my pocket money in order to get a 3060 graghics card or higher configuration(I wish).<br>
